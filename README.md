# Processing-data-with-python

This is a simple example showing how to use Pandas to create a dataframe and the processing data with python. 

The **python script** has all the blocks of code together, for best results - run each block on Jupyter like the way it is shown in the pdf file. 

- It shows how to read from a *csv* and *json* file. 
- Cleaning data by filling zeros on the missing data or removing rows with invalid data. 
- Using for loop to count the number of rows with invalid data. 
- Simple data analysis such as Mean, Median and Standard Deviation of the data. 
- And finally, indexing to print first few data, select specific columns and using loc function to select specific row using a certain value.
