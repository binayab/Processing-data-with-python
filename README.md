# Processing-data-with-python

This is a simple example showing how to use Pandas to create a dataframe and the processing data with python. 

The jupyter notebook **data-processing-with-python.ipynb** shows the following steps: 

- It shows how to read from a *csv* and *json* file. 
- Cleaning data by filling zeros on the missing data or removing rows with invalid data. 
- Using *for loop* to count the number of rows with invalid data. 
- Simple data analysis such as **Mean, Median and Standard Deviation** of the data. 
- And finally, **indexing** to print first few data, select specific columns and using **loc function** to select specific row using a certain value.
